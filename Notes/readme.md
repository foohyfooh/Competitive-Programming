# Competitive Programming Notes

This is a collection of some of the algorithms and tips that I have learnt during my time doing competitive progamming.

## Requirements
- LaTeX

## Notes
- I don't guarantee that all of the code or algorithms in my notes are entirely correct
- If you believe there is an issue in my code submit a PR to correct it
- I most likely will reject PRs for algorithms that I don't understand

## Credits
The code in the [other folder](/Notes/other) is code that I didn't write and have copied from other sources, and such their authors' deserve credit for it.

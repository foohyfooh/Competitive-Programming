\subsection{Impartial Combinatorial Games}

\textbf{Conditions}
\begin{itemize}
\item There are two players
\item There is a set of possible game states.
\item Each games state has legal moves and both players have the same legal moves for each game state.
\item The players take turns.
\item The game ends when a terminal state (state without legal moves) is reached. The next player to move loses.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item Winning or W-states: the current player is guaranteed to win (if they play optimally)
\item Losing or L-states: the current player is guaranteed to lose (if the opponent plays optimally)
\item All terminal states are L-states.
\item Every W-State leads at least one move to an L-state.
\item For every L-state, all moves lead to W-states.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Solution} \\
Using a bottom-up approach, \\
If any move from the state leads to an L-state then it is a W-state \\
If any move from the state leads to a W-state then it is an L-state \\
